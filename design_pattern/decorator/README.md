# Decorator
Facilitates the addtion of behaviors to individual object

## Motivation

1. Augment an object with addional functionality
2. Do not want to rewrite/alter existing code
3. Keep the new functionality separate
4. Decorated object can still interact with existing structures

## Two ways to do it

1. aggregate the decorated object
2. inherit from the decorated object
